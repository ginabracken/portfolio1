The first change I made is adding a countdown timer  under the burpees. When users click the burpees button then are brough to a page where they can start a countdown timer of 30 seconds to complete interval workouts!

The second change I made is adding a checklist where users can check off which workouts they completed and then it lists it out to them which ones they checked off. This will help users be accountable for what workouts they have completed and which ones they still have to do.

Also added some slight CSS by making the text blue!
